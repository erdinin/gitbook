**hello frens** ðŸ‘¾ðŸ§ª &#x20;

* I am trying to contribute to the projects working in the PoS (Proof-of-Stake) network at an early stage.
* I prepare testnet guides, node installation guides, update guides of projects in Turkish language.
* Iâ€™m interested in validating also iâ€™m looking to collaborations to validate and provide value.
* 
## Active Testnets
I participate in various testnet projects, contributing to their ecosystem growth and stability:

- [Chainbase](testnet/chainbase.md)
- [Hemi Network](testnet/hemi-network.md)
- [Hyperlane](testnet/hyperlane.md)
- [t3rn](testnet/t3rn.md)
- [Unichain](testnet/unichain.md)

## Finished Testnets
These are the networks where I previously ran a validator node, but the testnet/mainnet phase has concluded:

- [Andromeda](finished/andromeda.md)
- [Base](finished/base.md)
- [BEVM](finished/bevm.md)
- [Dymension](finished/dymension.md)
- [Espresso](finished/espresso.md)
